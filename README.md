# Introduction
Medicare provider fraud occurs when healthcare providers intentionally deceive Medicare to obtain unlawful payments for services not rendered, services not medically necessary, or services that were misrepresented. This criminal activity undermines the integrity of the Medicare program and contributes to higher healthcare costs for everyone.
Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of fraud by providers are:
- Billing for services not rendered.
- Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.
- Misrepresenting the service provided.
- Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was provided.
- Billing for services that were not offered to patients.
