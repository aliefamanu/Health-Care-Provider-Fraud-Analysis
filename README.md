# Introduction
Medicare provider fraud occurs when healthcare providers intentionally deceive Medicare to obtain unlawful payments for services not rendered, services not medically necessary, or services that were misrepresented. This criminal activity undermines the integrity of the Medicare program and contributes to higher healthcare costs for everyone.
Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of fraud by providers are:
- Billing for services not rendered.
- Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.
- Misrepresenting the service provided.
- Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was provided.
- Billing for services that were not offered to patients.

# Objective
The goal is to develop a machine learning model to detect potential fraudulent providers based on the claims filed by them.

# Dataset
For this project, we are working with Inpatient claims, Outpatient claims, and Beneficiary details of each provider:
A) Inpatient Data: This data provides insights about the claims filed for those patients who are admitted to the hospitals. It also provides additional details like their admission and discharge dates and the admitted diagnosis code.
B) Outpatient Data: This data provides details about the claims filed for those patients who visit hospitals and are not admitted to them.
C) Beneficiary Details Data: This data contains beneficiary KYC details like health conditions, the region they belong to, etc.
